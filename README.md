Machine Learning Engineering Portfolio (2026 Roadmap)

Hi, I'm Anietie Ben. This repository tracks my journey to becoming a production-ready ML Engineer. My focus for 2026 is Reproducibility, Deployment, and Technical Documentation.


Projects to Implement:
[GNN-Grid-Stability] – Deep Learning-Enhanced PMU using Graph Neural Networks for Grid Stability and Fault Detection.
[Ayo-Game-AI] – Reinforcement Learning approach. (Goal: Deployable web game).
[Gender-Classification] – Computer Vision with bias analysis. (Goal: Model Card documentation).
